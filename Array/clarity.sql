/*Technical Interview
SQL Prompt:
A simple fruit stand store maintains data about itsâ€™ fruit sales.
One table (Fruit_Fact) holds this information -the transaction price, the fruit sold, the quantity sold, a transaction number and the date.  
Ex.) Transaction 1 had 2 Apples sold on July 1, 2012. For $2.00.
E.g.) Fruit_Fact, an example row
Trans_Num
Fruit
Quantity
Date
Cum_Price
0000000001
Apple
2
20150603
2.00

As you can see, a row can contains only one type of fruit, but can hold multiple sales of that fruit for a given transaction. 
Exercises in SQL -
1)  What are all the different fruits we have ever sold?
2)  What are all the different fruits sold today?
3)  What fruits were sold today, that were not sold yesterday? Can you do this with at least three different methods?
4)  How many of each type of fruit did we sell today?
5)  How many of each type of fruit was sold during each month in 2015? What are all the different fruits sold in 2015 that sold at least 50 (Quantity) in that month?
